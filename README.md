# Roguelike-lib for Indigo
This is meant to be a library that provides general facilities such
as a data struture to representing the typical roguelike terminal. The
goal is to simplify things so that anybody interested in creating a
roguelike on the [Indigo Engine](https://indigoengine.io/) can
develop their roguelike focusing on their game logic rather than
more general "boiler plate" stuff that is already facilitated
by libraries such as python's [tcod](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This is very much a work in progress.

## What are roguelikes?

[Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)'s are a type of game that get their name because they are ...wait for it ..._like_ an 80s game called _Rogue_!

They typically use ASCII art for graphics, generated levels / dungeons and feature things like perma-death.

## How to package and use this library
**TODO**
